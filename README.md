# AppLauncher
A useless launcher for april fools **(couldn't post this on April 1st for reasons)**

This file will only point out 2 lines which you'll need for the main launcher

**on line 9** you can set an original account, with the first parameter being the username and the second being the password
**on line 16** you change your icon with the _iconbitmap_ function, so convert your icon into a .ico file or use another function of your choice
**on line 114** you run a command of your choice, normally to open the application you wanna launch

# Warning
